## How to start a server locally:
1. Clone this repo, and install node.js with npm.
2. Open a terminal in the top level folder- the one that contains "app.js". Type npm install in that folder. This will install all the required node.js packages.
3. Run the server! In the top level folder, typing "./start_dev_server.sh" runs the server on port 7301.

## Happy spacewarring!
