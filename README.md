## How to start a server locally:
1. Clone this repo, install node.js and npm if not already installed.
2. Open a terminal in the top level folder- the one that contains "app.js". Type npm install in that folder. This will install all the required node.js packages.
3. Run the server! In the top level folder, typing "./start_dev_server.sh". You should see a message that says "Server initialized successfully. Game log below."
4. Navigate to "127.0.0.1:7301" in your browser and you should be able to play.

## Happy spacewarring!
