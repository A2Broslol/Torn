This Starfighter: Disputed Galaxy website was written by Jester, who goes by the callsign JesterGvE in the game, and Jestertrek on Kongregate.  Jester is the leader of the <b>Good v. Evil</b> human gang (Sector S-11-9, color: dark red), and <b>The Second Rising</b> alien gang (Sector S-9-15, color: indigo).  If you've enjoyed this site, please join one of my gangs!  :-)</p>

Starfighter is a great game, but kind of complicated.  Hopefully this guide will be of some use.  You can also visit these two sites:<br>
<a href="http://www.disputedgalaxy.com/"><b>Starfighter: Disputed Galaxy Official Website</b></a>: Good charts on ship classes, some info about weapons, and a decent FAQ<br>
<a href="http://pheermee.googlepages.com/home"><b>PheerMee - A Newbs FAQ to Starfighter</b></a>: Not really for newbs, but has some really good info<br></p><p>

<i>Thanks to DiditzZz, Darth Sirov, and M5000, Starfighter players all, for helpful tips and suggestions about this site.  Thanks, guys!</i><p>
