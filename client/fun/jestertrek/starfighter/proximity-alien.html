<span class="head">How to read the Proximity Weapon Tables</span><p>

Each Weapon is rated in its <b>damage</b>, <b>radius</b>, <b>effect</b>, <b>duration</b>, and for its <b>ammunition</b>.  Each rating includes a grade from A+ (best) to F (worst).  Damage also includes a numerical rating of Shield damage.  Ammunition includes a count of the number of shots.  Effect and duration include a number of seconds. for that factor.</p><p>

<b>Damage:</b> This is a rough estimation of the amount of Shield damage this weapon will do on a successful hit, and a grade both damage and damage per second.  The higher the damage, the higher the grade.<br>
<b>Radius:</b> This is a rating of the Weapon's radius about the firing ship, generally reflecting how useful the range of the Weapon is going to be in actual combat.<br>
<b>Effect:</b> This is the amount of time before this Proximity Weapon will take effect, and a rating of that period of time.<br>
<b>Duration:</b> This is the amount of time the Proximity Weapon will remain in effect, and a rating of that period of time.<br>
<b>Ammunition:</b> This is a count and a rating of the Weapon's ammunition, generally reflecting how useful the ammo load of that particular Weapon is going to be in real combat.</p>

<b>How to use it:</b> The Electrostatic Field Disruptor is one of those goofy little weapons that probably sounded much better on paper than it works in actual practice.  What this weapon will do is push your opponent about 500 distance away in a random direction, with a random facing.  It will also kill their momentum, even momentum gained by the Engine Overdrive Utility.  It also seems to disrupt the Tractor Beam Utility, and probably other "beam" Utilities as well (more testing is needed on this).  Finally, it does about 25 points of Shield damage to the target struck.  So, in terms of versatility, the EFD is the most versatile of the Proximity Weapons.  The effect of the Weapon is also instant, and it uses Energy rather than ammunition, 25% Energy per shot, which is reasonable and earns the EFD a good grade for ammunition.  The radius of this weapon is also quite good, about 250 distance from the ship, roughly equal to the <a href="#db">Damage Bubble</a>.</p><p>

All that said, the Electrostatic Field Disruptor seems to be a weapon without a good purpose.  Most ships -- all ships, really -- with Proximity Weapon slots tend to be better in close combat than when not in close combat.  As a result, a Proximity Weapon that pushes an opponent out of close combat seems to be actively counter-productive.  If the <a href="ships-alien.html#oppressor">Oppressor</a> had been given a Proximity Weapon slot, then I wouldn't have anything to say; the EFD would be the perfect choice for that ship.  But it wasn't, and neither was the <a href="ships-alien.html#hunter">Hunter</a>, which would seem to have a need for this kind of Weapon.  In tests, I only encountered a few situations where another Proximity Weapon wouldn't be a better choice.  Its best effects seemed to be had in MP sectors, where using an Electrostatic Field Disruptor did a good job of breaking up my opponents' momentum (and got me called some rather amusing names in the process).</p><p>

Other than the above, there are no major disadvantages to the Electrostatic Field Disruptor.  The damage is much less than other Proximity Weapons, of course, but every weapon with a special effect has this flaw, and with less expensive weapons generally.  In particular, the EFD is quite cheap, and is a quick, reasonably Energy-efficient way of clearing early game AI Drone ambushes, especially in an <a href="ships-alien.html#conqueror">Conqueror</a>, where this Weapon can be mixed in with other more effective ones in the very early game.  Still, this is not really a Proximity Weapon that I can recommend unless it is mated to some strategy linked to the ship's other weapons.  Have a plan before you buy this and install it!</p>

<b>How to use it:</b> The Thunder Bolt is the hardest Proximity Weapon to use well in Starfighter.  The damage that it can potentially do is massive: up to 150 points of Shield damage.  This damage is particularly horrifying if it is combined with an active <a href="weapons-alien.html#tbtorp">Thunder Bolt Torpedo</a> or <a href="mines-alien.html#tbmine">Thunder Bolt Mine</a> active against the same target.  In this condition, the target will very rapidly bleed Shields and will almost certainly expire unless the affected pilot takes immediate and drastic defensive action.  That alone is often worth the use of this weapon; nothing panics players in MP Starfighter faster than multiple Thunder Bolt weapons used against them.  The range of the Thunder Bolt Proximity Weapon is also outstanding.  In tests, I was able to damage targets -- even fleeing targets -- at ranges of more than 900 distance, though in general a radius of 500 or so is more workable in actual battle.  Still, this makes the Thunder Bolt far and away the highest range Proximity Weapon, comparable to several full Weapons.</p><p>

Diving into an AI ambush with a Thunder Bolt active is devastating.  The Thunder Bolt will only inflict that measure of its damage on a single target that's needed.  As a result, if you are surrounded by seven AI Drones and a Heavy Drone, the Thunder Bolt will almost certainly destroy them all, allocating 11 points of damage to each Drone and 55 to the Heavy Drone.  You can't ask much more of a Proximity Weapon than that!  Many Large Weapons would be hard pressed to match that performance!  However, this effect is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  If the ambush is actually five Starfighters, then each of the five will take between 25 and 30 points of damage, and <i>none</i> of them will be destroyed.  You will instead be surrounded by damaged but still very much active opponents.  So, the Thunder Bolt has to be deployed carefully and with some forethought to the effect that you want out of it.</p><p>

That's not the only disadvantage, either.  Like all Proximity Weapons, the Thunder Bolt will be just as likely to attack allies as enemies.  If you enter battle with several AI Drones on your side, you can very easily destroy them (and have kills and Bounty subtracted for doing so) if you use this Weapon.  The ammunition for this weapon is also sub-par, with only one "shot" available.  However, if you activate a Thunder Bolt while another one is active, the effects of the two will <i>stack</i>, as noted above.  The Thunder Bolt will activate immediately, and if it is not needed, will remain in effect on your ship for ten or more seconds, waiting for targets to attack.  It is quite frequent with this Weapon that you'll almost have forgotten that you activated it, only to be informed that you've cut down an enemy (or a friendly) Drone that crosses your path...</p><p>

Finally, the Thunder Bolt is far and away the most expensive Weapon of any non-Large type in the game (and it is more expensive than all but one of the alien Large Weapons!).  This will prevent its use in the early game, and restrict this Weapon to the use of more experienced Starfighter players.  Still, be cautious when using the Thunder Bolt and have a plan for doing so!  Otherwise, it will probably do you more harm than good.  All that said, the Thunder Bolt is extremely popular with Starfighter veterans, and there's some debate about whether this or the <a href="#pb">Proximity Blaster</a> is the best Proximity Weapon for use by experts.</p>

<b>How to use it:</b> The Damage Bubble is a very popular Proximity Weapon choice for AI enemies, quite often one of only two Proximity Weapon that you will see AIs use (with the <a href="#tb">Thunder Bolt</a>).  It is also very dangerous, particularly to alien players who prefer dogfighting to long range sniping.  The Damage Bubble will be quite visible around the ship using it, as a pair of golden discs orbiting the ship.  Anyone who enters the circle described by these discs will be rapidly damaged by the bubble, to the tune of between 15 and 25 points of Shield damage <i>per second</i> spent in the bubble.  Basic math will show how dangerous this is; any human fighter that remains inside a bubble will be dead in ten seconds or less.  Even human capital ships such as Warships and Medusae can be destroyed in an average of between 16 and 18 seconds inside a Damage Bubble.  This is excellent but what's even better is that a Damage Bubble will persist around your ship for a full 40 seconds.  This will be sufficient for you to use it several battles.</p><p>

The radius of the Damage Bubble is quite good, around 250 distance around your ship.  It also takes effect instantly and continuously after you activate it.  Against human ships who use the Tractor Beam Utility against you, the Damage Bubble is devasting.  You cannot turn a Tractor Beam off once you've turned it on, which means that your enemies have immediately inflicted at least 100 Shield damage to themselves by doing so if they pull you within the radius, and likely more.  Like the <a href="#prox">Proximity Blaster</a>, it also appears that the closer you can pull your enemies to you, the more damage per second you will inflict on them with this Proximity Weapon.</p><p>

Of course, no good thing comes without cost, and the Damage Bubble has many disadvantages.  First, it is equally harmful to both enemies and allies.  If you choose to use this Proximity Weapon in a busy combat, particularly one in which AI friendly Drones and Heavy Drones are involved, be prepared to destroy a lot of these allies, and lose one kill and some Bounty each for doing so!  This alone may dissuade you from using this Weapon.  In addition, ammunition for this weapon is only a single "shot" lasting 40 seconds.  This is a small disadvantage, since the duration is actually quite long in combat conditions, but it is a factor.</p><p>

One final note: the effects of the Damage Bubble <i>stacks</i> with additional Damage Bubbles deployed by you, your allies, or your enemies.  If you activate a Damage Bubble, then are immediately restocked with one (by a "A" ammunition bonus drop, or a "AA" full ammunition bonus drop), you can deploy this second Damage Bubble over the first, and immediately begin doing 30-50 points of Shield damage, per second, to your enemies!  Likewise, if both you and an ally have Damage Bubbles active around an enemy ship, that enemy ship will be likewise affected.  Be wary of approaching multiple enemy ships all with active Damage Bubbles!  This condition can make your life painful and short.</p>

<b>How to use it:</b> The EMP Blast is one of those weapons that will get you called all sorts of names in Multiplayer sectors.  Trigger it, and anything you're close to, in a <i>wide</i> radius around your ship, will be immediately rendered powerless for between five and nine seconds.  This gives you the opportunity to destroy the target at your leisure, or escape.  This Proximity Weapon is a major reason why the human <a href="utilities-human.html#eeb">Energy Extraction Beam</a> is so popular: human players don't want to get struck by this weapon, and routinely deprive alien players who use it of the power necessary to fire it.  That said, human players are a little more likely to be close dogfighters and see a more immediately need an use for this Proximity Weapon than alien players.  However, it is equally devasting, or even more so, in Single Player sectors.  An EMP Blast triggered near the largest human warships will allow you to destroy them at little risk to yourself, or at least maneuver in behind them.</p><p>

The EMP Blast is particularly useful in the hands of newer Starfighter players who are getting used to the damage and power of unguided weapons like the <a href="weapons-alien.html#pc">Plasma Cannon</a> and the <a href="weapons-alien.html#javelin">Javelin Torpedo</a>.  EMP Blast your target, and while they are helpless, you will have plenty of time to line up your shots with these weapons and practice your marksmanship and timing.  In particular, launching Javelins on enemy Triton Cargo Ships or their capital ships is a breeze if you first EMP Blast them, then maneuver to face their broadsides.  The EMP Blast is also quite useful in <a href="questions.html#coop">Multiplayer Sectors</a> where you're facing hackers who are your "allies."  You can EMP Blast the hackers trying to destroy you, which will make escape from them quite easy.  The EMP Blast used against AI allies will prevent them from stealing your kills, too.  ;-)</p><p>

Really, the EMP Blast has two major downsides.  The first and more serious are its massive power requirements.  A single EMP Blast requires 50% of your Energy, which will make it much more difficult for you to take advantage of the disabled state of your enemies.  Unless you have an <a href="utilities-alien.html#ec">Energy Cell</a> ready to go, you may not have the Energy you need to finish them off.  As a result, don't take this Proximity Weapon without first considering what other Weapons and strategy you're going to link it to!  Second, the EMP Blast does no damage to its targets in and of itself, and for ships with only a limited number of weapon slots (such as the <a href="ships-alien.html#shredder">Shredder</a>), the EMP Blast is a poor choice because you'll want to devote every slot you have to damaging weapons.</p>

<b>How to use it:</b> The Proximity Blaster is an excellent, basic Proximity Weapon, and the one that Starfighter players who can't decide between the others should take.  It's primary advantage is its high damage, which varies quite a bit between the edges of the blast and the center of the blast, but averages between 70 and 90 points of Shield damage <i>per shot</i>.  More than any other Proximity Weapon, the closer you are to the source of a prox blast, the more damage you will take from it.  Three of them at very close range are sufficient to destroy any human fighter in the game, and seriously damage heavier targets.  Even better, it does this same damage to everything in the circle, equally.  As a result, you can dive into an AI ambush, firing the Proximity Blaster as quickly as you can and routinely kill several enemies at once with it.  Particularly against ambushes of Drones, Heavy Drones, and Pegasi, the Proximity Blaster is devastating.</p><p>

It is also quite a useful weapon for slower ships that aren't good dogfighters to attack and destroy quick, maneuverable ships for this reason.  If you are having particular difficulty destroying an Astro or an Argonaut, for instance, two Proximity Blaster shots will do the trick, and against Pegasi, only one such blast is needed.  The Proximity Blaster is also a useful defense against the Tractor Beam Utility.  The closer your enemy draws you in using this Utility, the more damage the Proximity Blaster will do in return.</p><p>

Like all Proximity Weapons, the Proximity Blaster hurts both friend and foe, and it's unfortunately very common to destroy allies with this weapon.  In addition, the effect time before the Proximity Blast will fire after it has been triggered is rather long, a full one second.  If you aren't particularly good in your timing, your target or targets will escape before the blast hits them.  The radius of this weapon is also sub-standard, affecting targets out to about 150 distance away from your ship.  However, the effective radius of this weapon is slightly larger than the displayed radius, so don't despair if it looks like your target is just out of your effective range.  The final disadvantage of this weapon is that it must be triggered.  It is not passive in the way the <a href="#tb">Thunder Bolt</a> or <a href="#db">Damage Bubble</a> are.</p><p>

Still, if you can get beyond these disadvantages, the Proximity Blaster will serve you well.  It is quite often the choice of veteran Starfighter players, who highly praise its damage and ammunition.</p>
