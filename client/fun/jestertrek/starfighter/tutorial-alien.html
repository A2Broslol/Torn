<span class="head">Your first 50,000 credits</span><p>

The purpose of this guide is to get you familiar with Starfighter and help you earn your first 50,000 credits and your first 25 kills or so.  After that, you're on your own but at least you'll have a very solid foundation for starting out.</p>

<p class="title">Starting Screens, Buying a Ship</p><p>
OK, first create an account, select Alien, and get logged in.  You'll see this screen to start:<br>
<img src="images/alien-start.png" width=566 height=410><br>

Look closely at #1 and #2.  You'll be using these options a lot, particularly to start.  The mission selector is how you get missions.  Missions are the easiest way to make money, so you'll be taking a lot of them.  #2 is your shop.  This is where you buy your ship, your weapons, and upgrades for your ship such as utilities and new engines.  This is also where you buy new lives, as you lose them.</p><p>

You're currently docked at a space station.  #3 is how you leave.  A lot of new players seem to miss this option for some reason.  Don't feel bad.  I missed it too, when I first started out.  But don't leave the space station just yet.  Let's buy your first new ship.</p><p>

Select option #2 (Go to Shop).  You'll see this screen:<br>
<img src="images/alien-shop.png" width=568 height=409></p><p>

#1 is where you buy new ships.  #2 is where you buy new lives as you lose them.  #3 is where you exit the shop.  On this screen, select #1 (Change Ship).  You'll see this screen:<br>
<img src="images/alien-ship.png" width=566 height=410></p><p>

These are the various ships you have access to.  As you score kills (kill bad guys in the game), you will unlock additional ships.  You can only have one ship at a time and once you buy a new ship, you lose your old ship <b>and all its upgrades</b>.  So don't buy a new ship until you have the money to buy all the weapons and upgrades you want for it.  However, when you buy a new ship, your lives reset back to 10, so sometimes this is a good way to get a fresh start.</p><p>

The ship marked #1 is the Sprinter.  Click on it and you'll see a close-up picture of the ship and all of its statistics, and at the bottom, the price (it should be 250 credits to upgrade to this ship).  Don't worry about the stats yet.  You can learn these later as you learn more about the game.  Just trust me: this is the ship you want to learn the game in.  Buy it (yellow "Buy") at the bottom.  You can't afford any utilities or weapons yet, so don't worry about these for now.  Let's just learn to fly our new ship a bit.  Exit the shop, then Exit the Space Station.</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">Learning to Fly</p><p>
Now you see this screen:<br>
<img src="images/alien-space.png" width=567 height=410></p><p>

This is where you play most of the game.  Use your arrow keys to fly around a bit.  Get used to your ship.  On the upper right is your shield display, and below it a report of hostiles and friendlies in the sector.  Red arrows will point to any hostiles nearby, but ignore them.  Your allies will blow them up for you, and you don't want to get into any fights yet.  The radar display is right below that.  Also, look for an orange arrow.  This points at the closest asteroid.  First, we're going to do some mining to get used to flying around and making a little money.  Hit the forward arrow to start moving forward, then steer to the closest asteroid until the range by the orange arrow drops below 500.  Wiggle a bit (use left-right arrow) and your ship will lock onto the asteroid.  The asteroid will appear in the upper left, with an orange bar.  Now hit the "Z" key several times.  You'll notice the orange bar drop, and on the top of the screen, the "Mining" number will go up.  Keep hitting Z until the orange bar drops to nothing.  Now fly back to the space station (white arrow).  You'll notice that your "Mining" number drops to 0 and your "Money" number will go up.  Go to the next closest asteroid (orange arrow) and repeat the process.</p><p>

You'll notice every time you hit Z to fire your mining laser, your energy will drop a bit.  Most weapons use energy.  If your energy drops to 0, then you have to wait -- it will slowly recharge.  Mine all the asteroids in the sector, then hit Q to dock with the space station.  Immediately exit the space station and go out mining again.  Ignore any enemy ships (or run away from them).  Your Sprinter is the fastest ship in the game, so they shouldn't be able to catch you.  Every time you run out of energy or if you don't see an orange arrow, go back to the base and dock, then immediately exit again to continue.  Keep mining until you have over 2000 money.  This should take you about 10 minutes.</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">Your First Mission</p><p>
Got your 2000?  Good.  Go back to the shop, and click the "Buy" next to your "Utilities".  At the bottom will be a Utility called "Engine Overdrive."  Buy it.  It will cost 2000 credits.  Your Sprinter will be outfitted with this massive engine utility, almost covering your whole ship.</p><p>

Now that you have it, ready to make some serious money?  OK, let's go on a mission.  Exit the shop, then click "Go to Mission Selector".  You'll see a screen that looks like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-mission.png" width=570 height=407></p><p>

You're looking for a mission that looks like #1: a "Courier" mission that pays 1000 credits.  If you don't see one right away, click "More Missions" at the bottom until you do.  There are an infinite number of missions, so don't worry about running out.  When you find a Courier mission that pays 750, click "Accept", then Exit Space Station.  Now you have a blue arrow.  The blue arrow is pointing to where your Courier mission will end.  Hit the "3" key to activate your Engine Overdrive, then hit the "P" key.  This is your auto-pilot.  It will fly you in the direction of your Courier mission.  Now hit "Z" to activate your Engine Overdrive.  ZOOOM.  You'll rocket across the sector until you hit a green "edge of sector" line.  You'll then cross into a new sector.  Every time you enter a new sector, just hit "3", then "Z".  Stay on auto-pilot, crossing sector after sector.  Ignore any enemies.  You don't have the weapons to fight with.</p><p>

Eventually, you'll reach your target sector, you'll see "autopilot disengaged" at the bottom of the screen, and there will be a new blue arrow.  Follow it to a new space station.  You can't auto-pilot inside a sector.  If you happen to pass an asteroid, go ahead and mine it.  To do so, hit "0" to switch to your mining laser, then "Z" to mine, just like before.  If you're attacked in this new sector, hit "3", then "Z", then hold down the forward arrow to run away.  When you reach the space station, hit "Q" to dock, and boom.  You just made a fast 1000 credits.  This should take you about 5 minutes.</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">Your First Weapon, Your First Kills</p><p>
Now that you're back to base, let's buy a weapon.  Go to the shop, and click "Buy" next to your first weapon slot.  You'll see this screen:<br>
<img src="images/alien-weapon.png" width=569 height=407></p><p>

There are lots of weapons, and you can learn how they all work later.  For now, just buy the weapon I've marked with the #1, the "Type 3 Carnivore Torpedo".  This will cost you 500 credits.  You'll now see your ship has a little blue missile under the left wing.  You can now defend yourself.  Exit from the Shop, and go back to the mission selector.  Now that you've completed your first mission, there should be more profitable Courier missions available.  In particular, you should find one that pays about 2000 credits.  This is a Courier mission where you will probably get ambushed on the way.  Don't worry.  You have a good weapon to defend yourself with.  Go ahead and Accept a 2000 credit Courier mission, then exit the space station.</p><p>

Every ship has a basic laser cannon.  You fire it with the space bar.  It's a decent weapon, but very short range.  Your new type 3 carnivores have a range of 10000.  This is the longest range weapon in the game.  We'll learn how to fire it in a second.  For now, let's get going.  Hit "P" to go on auto-pilot, then hit "3", then "Z" to get on your way.  Ignore any sector that has both friendlies and hostiles, or any sector with friendlies only.  Just rocket through, staying on auto-pilot.</p><p>

Wait until you reach a sector with no friendlies, but a lots of hostiles.  (If on your first 2000 credit Courier mission, this never happens, great!  Accept the money, accept a new Courier mission worth a lot of money, and come back to this tutorial.)  When you get ambushed, it will look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-ambush1.png" width=569 height=409></p><p>

Notice right above the radar: 6 hostiles, 0 friendlies.  This is an ambush.  You'll get ambushed a lot.  Initially, the bad guys will be drones, the weakest alien enemy.  Hit "P" to turn off your auto-pilot, then hit back arrow to slow to a stop.  Now hit "1" to activate your carnivore torpedoes.  The red arrow will point the way to the closest enemy.  When the number next to it drops to 10000, wiggle your wings a little bit, and the missile will lock.  It will look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-ambush2.png" width=568 height=408></p><p>

Hit the "Z" key twice and you'll see two carnivores race away from your ship.  Wait about five or six seconds, and the drone will explode.  You won't see it, but your Kills score on the bottom right will go up by 1, and you'll see "Destroyed an enemy Drone" on your status window on bottom.  Your missiles will lock onto a new drone.  Hit the "Z" key twice again, wait five seconds for the missiles to hit and kill the drone, and repeat until they're all dead.  You might have to back up slowly (back arrow key) to keep from getting swarmed.  Mid-battle, it will look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-ambush3.png" width=567 height=409></p><p>

You make 10-20 credits for each drone you kill at this level.  This is called Bounty, and is displayed at the top of the screen.  Bounty is paid when you return to base.  Fire only two carnivores at each drone!  That's all that's needed to kill them.  You should end the battle with 1 carnivore left.  Hit "P" to turn auto-pilot back on, then "3", then "Z" to activate Engine Overdrive, and get out of this sector.  Your missiles reset to full ammo (15, for type 3 carnivores) when you enter a new sector.  If you're ambushed again, just repeat what's above to kill the new ambush.  When you reach the sector as your base, you'll see the auto-pilot disengage.  Hit "3" and "Z" and steer yourself back to base (blue arrow), and hit "Q" to dock.  Congratulations!  You just got your first kills.</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">Gimme That Laser Beam!</p><p>
Repeat these Courier missions a few times until you have 3000 credits.  Then go to the shop, click on the "Buy" next to your weapon #2, and buy a Laser Beam (it's the third weapon down on the list).  This is a very powerful starting weapon.  Your ship should now look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-sprinter.png" width=568 height=408></p><p>

The red dot under your right wing is your laser beam emitter.  This weapon has a range of 500, and is for close-up dog-fighting.  It uses a <b>lot</b> of energy (30% per shot), but will kill a drone in one shot.  Your energy will then slowly regenerate.  Take it out for a spin!  Take another Courier mission, wait to be ambushed, then use your type 3 carnivores to kill every drone <b>except one</b>.  Let that drone come in close, run toward it, let it pass you (you'll probably be shot at a couple of times -- try to dodge!), then turn around and get behind it.  Now hit "2" to activate your Laser Beam.  Get within 500, wiggle your wings a bit, and the laser will lock.  Now it should look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-dogfight.png" width=568 height=410></p><p>

Hit "Z" and kill it!  It will explode quite satisfactorily.  It will also leave behind a little bonus.  That might look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-kill.png" width=568 height=409></p><p>

The bonuses that are dropped do various things.  A red cross refills your shields to max.  A blue lightning bolt refills your energy to max.  A box with both refills both.  A small green "A" reloads one random weapon or utility.  A small brown "AA" refills them all.  And a little black euro symbol gives extra Bounty.  If you don't need the bonus, you won't pick it up.  For instance, if you're already at 100% energy, nothing will happen when you pass over a blue lightning bolt bonus.</p><p>

As you fly around doing Courier missions, you'll start running into new enemies.  Instead of ambushes, these will be one or two hostiles in a sector, usually larger alien ships.  Type 3 carnivores do about 10-12 shield damage, so you can try the carnivores out on them, or get close and use your laser beam, which does about 45-50 damage.  Try killing aliens that don't look too hard (100 or so shield), to start.  Your Sprinter only has a 50 shield, so don't try anything bigger than this yet!</p><p>

You might get killed once or twice along the way.  Don't worry about this too much, but don't let your lives drop below 5 or so!  If they do, buy lives at the shop.  Also, some sectors have black holes in them.  If you get destroyed by an "undefined", that's what you found.  You can steer around black holes if you're careful.  Keep running Courier missions, killing ambushes (practice your dog-fighting and manuevering each time!), and mining the occasional rock that runs across your path.  As you get more confident, try dog-fighting for real.  Get in behind a drone and try to kill it with the space bar laser beam.  It takes two shots in a row to kill a drone; the space bar laser beam does about 8 damage per hit, but the drone's shield will regenerate, just like yours.  This is good practice, because all the best weapons in Starfighter are unguided.  Keep doing Courier missions until you make 10,000 credits.</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">Buy a Hyperdrive</p><p>
Now let's enter the big-time!  It's time to skip this traveling through sectors.  Why travel real-time when you can instantly jump where you want to go?  Go to the shop, and click the "Buy" next to your main engine, near the bottom of the screen right above your Lives count.  You'll get a new screen and it will look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-engines.png" width=568 height=410></p><p>

Buy the engine that costs 10,000, exit from the Shop, and find a good Courier mission.  Accept it, then exit the space station.  Now we're gonna have some fun.  Click "W" to bring up the hyperspace map.  It will look like this:<br>
<img src="images/alien-map.png" width=569 height=408></p><p>

Your current sector will be a slowly flashing white square.  The target sector for your Courier mission is a solid light blue square.  Click on Hyperspace on the upper right, then click on the sector with the light blue square.  Your ship will turn, accelerate to impressive speeds, then boom!  You will be instantly transported to your target sector.  Drive to the base (blue arrow) and claim your Courier mission bounty.  Elapsed time, about 30 seconds.  Cool, huh?  Dock with the base, take another Courier mission, then repeat this process to make LOADS of cash.  Your hyperspace engine requires 60 seconds to recharge after you use it once.  Many Courier missions will start requiring you to make two stops, one stop to pick up cargo, another to drop it off.  Use hyperspace, pass over the station to pick up the cargo, wait 60 seconds, then hyperspace to the destination.  You can do some mining while you wait, or attack any enemies that come near.</p><p>

Sprinter plus a hyperspace engnine is one of the fastest ways to make money in Starfighter.  Now that you have it, you can make 25,000 credits in under 15 minutes.</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">Your Second Ship, Your Second 25,000 Credits</p><p>
After you have 25,000 credits or so, consider buying a second ship.  A good second ship is the Marauder.  It's the fifth ship in the first row.  It's not as fast as the Sprinter, but it's much more maneuverable for dog-fighting and carries two mine slots.  Mines are weapons that drop from the rear of your ship, and the Marauder will let you experiment with them.  If you like dog-fighting, then try the Weaver or the Defender instead.  The Weaver is the most maneuverable ship in the game, but is very slow.  The Defender is even slower, but includes very powerful proximity weapons.  It's very nasty up close and is a favorite of alien aces.</p><p>

Something to keep in mind: as your ship gets more expensive, the Engines required for that ship also get more expensive, as do the cost of buying new Lives.  In fact, everything you add to a ship increases the cost of Lives for that ship, including upgraded Mining Lasers and the like.</p><p>

Once you buy a new ship, you lose all of your engine upgrades, weapons, and utilities, and have to start again.  However, you are reset back to 10 lives, so this is sometimes a good, cheap way to get your lives back up to 10.  You can switch back to your old ship, but you have to buy it again.  Sorry, but those are the breaks...</p>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="title">End of Tutorial</p><p>
You're now past the basics of Starfighter.  You can try out other ships, other weapons, and other tactics, but the basics provided to you in this guide will give you a firm foundation for the rest of your career.  If you've enjoyed this tutorial, feel free to join my gang, The Second Rising, which is based in sector S-9-15 (color: indigo).  Good luck and good hunting!</p>
