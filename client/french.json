			"desc":"A basic, medium range gun."
		},
		{
			"name":"Plasma Gun",
			"desc":"Only useful for up-close combat against larger, slower ships. Short in range, slow to shoot and slow to recharge, but packs one hell of a punch."
		},
		{
			"name":"Reverse Gun",
			"desc":"Get off my tail! Same specs as the stock gun, but shoots behind you and is 50% more powerful. A tad more pricey."
		},
		{
			"name":"Rifle",
			"desc":"Powerful, long-range, fast bullets. Does a lot of damage. Perfect for shooting at a large swarm of distant enemies."
		},
		{
			"name":"Shotgun",
			"desc":"This will come in handy in an ambush. Sprays a lot of bullets around where you shoot. Slightly hard to control."
		},
		{
			"name":"Machine Gun",
			"desc":"Rapid-fire! Ammunition is a bit weak, but that's no matter if you're shooting 13 rounds per second!"
		},
		{
			"name":"Minigun",
			"desc":"Same as the machine gun, with two active barrels instead of one, but slower bullets. Great weapon if you can aim it quickly."
		},
		{
			"name":"Plasma Beam",
			"desc":"Automatically aims at the nearest enemy within a small range and fires a beam of plasma."
		},
		{
			"name":"Laser Beam",
			"desc":"Automatically aims at the nearest enemy within a medium range and fires quick laser bursts. Each ray doesn't do as much damage as the plasma cannon, but it recharges much faster so more damage is done overall. Poor against bases due to high energy consumption."
		},
		{
			"name":"Hadron Beam",
			"desc":"Short-range particle beam accelerator. Does a lot of damage, but takes a while to recharge. Can be used as a quick trump card for close calls."
		},
		{
			"name":"Missile",
			"desc":"This missile will follow the nearest enemy and explode on impact. If there is no enemy in range, it will simply go straight. Be careful, though: the missile is relatively slow and can be outrun by quick enemies."
		},
		{
			"name":"Heavy Missile",
			"desc":"A slower missile that does more damage. Good tool against slower, stronger ships."
		},
		{
			"name":"EMP Missile",
			"desc":"Short-range missile that both damages the enemy and paralyzes them for 2 seconds. Use one when attacking a fast enemy head-on to stun them before they can dodge any guided projectiles. Effective against bases."
		},
		{
			"name":"Missile Swarm",
			"desc":"Fires a single missile which splits into a swarm of 6 missiles which will attack a large horde of enemies. Great tool to use against a large ambush of slower ships."
		},
		{
			"name":"Torpedo",
			"desc":"Ultra long-range fast missile."
		},
		{
			"name":"Mine",
			"desc":"A simple mine. It's hard for an enemy to follow you with these. Explodes on impact with an enemy ship."
		},
		{
			"name":"Laser Mine",
			"desc":"Fires high-power laser at enemies that get too close."
		},
		{
			"name":"EMP Mine",
			"desc":"Identical to the standard mine other than a little less damage. Paralyzes enemies for 3 seconds as well. Useful when you are being chased."
		},
		{
			"name":"Hull Nanobots",
			"desc":"Repairs you nice and quick on the go, but depletes your energy significantly."
		},
		{
			"name":"Photon Cloak",
			"desc":"Disguise yourself for 8 seconds for a quick getaway."
		},
		{
			"name":"Generator",
			"desc":"For each generator you carry, your weapons and energy charge 6% faster, but you turn a tenth slower."
		},
		{
			"name":"Turbo",
			"desc":"Forced induction tool which supplements your engine for greater acceleration. Power output increases while drifting. Multiple-use."
		},
		{
			"name":"Hyperdrive",

			"name":"Pulse Wave",
			"desc":"Pushes all nearby enemy ships away in an enormous explosion."
		},
		{
			"name":"Electromagnet",

		},
		{
			"name":"EMP Blast",
			"desc":"Everyone in the sector besides yourself is disabled for 4 seconds. Inconveniently, it takes 6 seconds to recharge. Single-use."
		},
		{
			"name":"Mining Laser",
			"desc":"Identical to the Laser Beam but only attacks asteroids and does more damage."
		},
		{
			"name":"Turret",
			"desc":"Place a base turret. You may only own one active turret at a time. To claim its kills and money that it earns from killing other players, fly within a 20 unit radius of it. Single-use. Cannot be placed in a sector with an enemy turret or base."
		},
		{
			"name":"Gravity Bomb",
			"desc":"Creates a small black hole upon explosion which dissipates in about 20 seconds. Be extremely cautious with this weapon- you have 3 seconds to run after deployment before implosion. It is recommended that you have a turbo on hand just incase. The vortex will wait until it is at least 500 units from a base before deploying. Single-use."
		},
		{
			"name":"Warp Drive",
			"desc":"Instant speed boost for fast travel, at the expense of energy and charge."

		},
		{
			"name":"Grenades",
			"desc":"Throw this at an enemy and it will explode on contact or 1 second after thrown, damaging their ship and knocking them back!"
		},
		{
			"name":"Muon Ray",
			"desc":"An extremely powerful beam weapon that must be aimed. Fires a high energy particle beam in the direction that your ship is facing which will do extremely heavy damage to anything it contacts. Can pass through multiple ships."
		},

			"name":"Energy Leech",
			"desc":"This beam weapon will harvest the energy of nearby opponent ships and give their energy to you."
		},
		{
			"name":"Supercharger",

		"Humans lack self-awareness. After destroying their planet of origin in armed conflict, they spread from solar system to solar system, polluting worlds and eliminating life. We tried to let them know that their behavior would ultimately be self-destructive, but they refused to listen. They continued to migrate unsustainably around the galaxy, so we stepped in with force. We decided to only attack new colonies of Humans near our own settlements to maintain influence in our share of the galaxy, but the humans reacted violently. They immediately attacked without restraint. We called for resources from neighboring galaxies but reinforcements will not arrive for several decades, so until then, we must suppress the Human crusade for the sake of our own lives, and for the fate of this galaxy.",
		"Ever since we lost planet Earth, the Human race has been hanging on to its existence by a thread- we left our solar system in search of other habitable planets with the sole hope of survival, but very few of them demonstrated promise for long-term settlement. Barren planets unsustainable of supporting life were terraformed into industrious planets to generate the resources we desperately needed to survive in alien worlds. After centuries of toil, the population began to grow and spread. For about a decade we lived in peace and prosperity, until a hostile force attacked. Maintaining our settlements was vital to our survival, so we had no option other than to fight back. Ever since, we have been in conflict with the alien race, and it's unlikely that this war won't end in either civilization's extinction. Please, help us emerge from this struggle alive."
